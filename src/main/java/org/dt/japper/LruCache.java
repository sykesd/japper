/**
 * Implement a very simple, but (mostly) thread-safe LRU-cache
 * Designed to be used by the DynamicFactory class to avoid a memory-leak
 * by never throwing away a created mapper
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE:</b> this is only mostly thread-safe. A leakage of the implementation detail
 * is that the backing store is a {@code Collections.synchronizedMap()}. But the instance
 * itself is not the object over which you should synchronize to iterate through
 * the collections returned by {@code keySet()}, etc.
 * </p>
 *
 * For now such iteration is not required. If it ever does become required we will
 * need to add a method that provides access to the object that needs to be used to
 * synchronize access, or switch to using something like Guava's caches
